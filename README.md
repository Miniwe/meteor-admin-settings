Creates `AdminSettings` collection which is auto published / subscribed

`AdminSettings` helper provide where user can access the value of a key like `AdminSettings.alertMessage`

Admins can add key / value pairs that are saved in a collection.

Should appear under `settings` in sidebar menu using new API :)
